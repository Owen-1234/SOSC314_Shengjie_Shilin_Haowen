# Project Proposal: Narrative Competition in the Global Energy Transition

## A Cross-National Computational Analysis of Media Framing (2020–2026)

### Research Topic & Objective

This project investigates the divergent narratives surrounding "Energy Transition" and "Carbon Neutrality" between Western mainstream media and Chinese state-affiliated English media. By analyzing articles from 2020 to the present, the study aims to quantify how different national entities "frame" climate policy to align with their respective geopolitical interests and domestic agendas.
